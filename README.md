## This is a WIP and I'll be pushing new changes while making progress within the course


This project is a dynamic fusion of cutting-edge technologies, designed to bring the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 to your fingertips. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.7.
It's a course I've taken in [Dev/Talles - OpenAI: Excercises & assistant with Angular + NestJS](https://cursos.devtalles.com/courses/openai-angular-nestjs), the courses platform of [Fernando Herrera](https://fernando-herrera.com).

:sparkles: **What's Inside?** :sparkles:

Here you'll find the [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) back end solution for my <a href="https://github.com/arrighidante/OpenAI-Angular-NestJS" target="blank"> Angular GPT app </a>.

 <p>A progressive, efficient and scalable server-side application for  <a href="https://github.com/arrighidante/OpenAI-Angular-NestJS" target="blank"> Angular GPT </a>.</p>

This project is about a platform where we harness the capabilities of OpenAI's library in Node.js, consumed by an Angular frontend styled with Tailwind CSS. It's not just about fetching information, but also about creating, editing, and generating images. But that's not all! You can also convert text to audio, configure your assistant, and much more. It's a whole new world of possibilities!
